# LLM-Battleground---Adversarial-Dialogue-Simulator
The LLM Battleground is a functional adversarial dialogue simulator. It forces Llama and Gemini into high-stakes, zero-concession debates using forced contrarianism. Designed to eliminate passive AI behavior, the script ensures a sharp back-and-forth and archives every round and final verdict into a local text log for a permanent record.
